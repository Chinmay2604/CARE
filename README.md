# CARE
CARE (Computer Assisted Respiratory Expert)
CARE is an intelligent diagnostic system that analyzes lung sound recordings to detect respiratory conditions such as COPD, URTI, Bronchiolitis, Pneumonia, or Healthy cases.
It uses a hybrid Deep Learning architecture combining GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to capture both temporal and spectral features of respiratory sounds for accurate predictions.

ðŸ”„ Project Workflow

1. Audio Preprocessing
 
   Load .wav recordings
 
   Normalize audio
 
   Validate file format and integrity

2. Feature Extraction
 
   Apply MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) to represent unique lung sound patterns
 
3. Model Training
 
   Train a GRU + CNN hybrid model using publicly available respiratory sound datasets
 
4. Model Saving
 
   Store trained models in .keras format for easy deployment
 
5. Web Interface
 
   Flask-based web app for audio upload, processing, and displaying predictions with confidence scores

ðŸš€ Planned Features

  Smart Audio Validation â€“ Rejects non-lung sound files automatically

  Drag & Drop Uploads â€“ Faster, user-friendly file input

  Condition Insights â€“ Detailed information and preventive measures based on predictions

  User Accounts & History â€“ Track long-term respiratory health trends

ðŸŽ¯ Mission

  CARE is designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection of respiratory disorders, helping enable timely medical intervention and better patient outcomes.
